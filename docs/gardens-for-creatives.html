<p><em>This article assumes that you are fairly familiar with digital gardens already. <br>If you’re new to the topic, try starting with <a class="internal-link" href="/digital-garden">digital garden</a>.</em></p>

<p><span class="newthought">Most digital gardens follow</span> a particular structure. They collect information and ideas, usually with some mechanism for drawing connections between them, with the goal being to build out a personal library and generate new ideas over time. Traditionally, they’re pretty intellectual – personal Knowledge management systems with a capital K.</p>

<p>Unquestioning, I originally  started alisa.wtf with the intention of having two separate areas: an analytical space (<span class="newthought">aka</span> the garden) and a creative space (like a portfolio). As I organized my content, the separation between these two types of content became less and less clear – I was so drawn to the <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" target="blank">ethos of digital gardens</a> that I couldn’t keep it from spilling into the creative half of my site, and it was quickly growing into a hydra of mixed objectives and disorganization.</p>

<p>I scrapped the arbitrary distinction of analytical vs. creative work and decided to reapproach the entire thing as a garden like my subconscious was coercing me to.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-a-garden">The anatomy of a garden</h2>

<p>Maggie Appleton defines <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" target="blank">six patterns</a> that exist across most digital gardens. Most of these fit alongside the ethos of creative work, except for these three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Always growing</strong> – bullets become outlines become drafts etc.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Learning in public</strong> and being okay with imperfection</li>
  <li>Organized by <strong><em>contextual relationship</em></strong> instead of <em>recently published</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These weren’t as easily traslateable, and there weren’t many examples online – but what felt like a lack of precedent turned into a pretty fun systems design problem.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">// Most of the stuff below this line is a really rough draft.</code></p>

<h3 id="always-growing">Always growing</h3>

<p>This is arguably the most straightforward of the three: just as intellectual ideas can develop into essays, so too can an inspired idea evolve into a creative work. But when I tried to put <em>inspired idea</em> to publishable post as an early work, I realized that’s not how my creative process happens. It comes as a brief moment of intuition that loses steam as soon as its written down as a <span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> to be expanded upon later.</p>

<p>So, maybe some creative ideas aren’t meant to be tended to quite so closely. Instead of using the growth stages to think about the literal steps of the creative process from conception to completion, I decided to shift my thinking towards how much intention I have left within that project.</p>

<p><span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> is used for projects where the bulk of intention is yet to come. Maybe it’s an early idea, or a rough draft.</p>

<p><span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> is used for projects that forsee ongoing intention. This is a good choice for open collections that build over time, like <a class="internal-link" href="/bagheera">Bagheera</a>, which I add to as I take more photos. If I was working on an illustration, I could upload the sketch or line art until I got around to coloring and shading.</p>

<p><span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> is used for projects that I no longer anticipate putting intention into. Most creative portfolios already show projects in this state, but I like that the metaphor sets a more open-ended and forgiving tone – a photoshoot could still be re-edited much like an article, inviting changes as my skills and creative eye gets better over time.</p>

<h3 id="learning-in-public">Learning in public</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reflective pieces on creative process (taking pics of pets)</li>
  <li>Resources I keep coming back to and taking notes in the wiki</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contextual-relationships">Contextual relationships</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Backlinking between learning in public pieces</li>
  <li>Plant/Root distinction over analytical/creative. Purposefulness</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-creativity">What this means for creativity</h2>

<p>I realize I’ve defined the system but haven’t done a whole lot to stress test it – I was tempted to</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">// Everything below this line will be rewritten. Woohoo revising in public!</code></p>

<h2 id="opportunity-1-growing-creative-projects">Opportunity 1: Growing creative projects</h2>

<p>For a while I entertained the idea of making a dedicated creative portfolio separate from the garden, since that seemed to be how others were approaching it. But it felt a little arbitrary to bisect my projects like that, especially when my creative and analytical stuff would probably influence each other. Why not just “grow” the creative stuff alongside everything else?</p>

<h3 id="growth-stages-for-creative-work">Growth stages for creative work</h3>

<p>Bringing in creative work was pretty straightforward, since gardens already have themes of growth. A digital garden grows from a couple of inspired bullet points to an outline to a full-fledged essay eventually. Creative projects have a similar pattern of growth, though they show up a little differently:</p>

<h2 id="opportunity-2-thinking-out-loud-pieces">Opportunity 2: “Thinking out loud” pieces</h2>

<p>With the focus on analytical thinking, I also didn’t see many personal reflections incorporated into gardens. Most gardeners appeared to use Twitter or have separate microblogs dedicated to releasing little streams of consciousness into the world, but I didn’t have these platforms, and it felt like a natural thing to include in my garden anyway.</p>

<h3 id="roots-for-learning--processing">Roots for learning &amp; processing</h3>

<p>When I tried sorting these stream-of-consciousness posts into the growth stages I discussed in Opportunity 1, it became quickly apparent that some posts are not meant to grow on their own. The ideas that <em>inspire</em> creative projects don’t always <em>grow into</em> the project itself, but are necessary as tools for processing and reflecting. I put these in their own category: <strong>Roots</strong>.</p>

<p>With a <span class="tag tag-grx sans no-margin-left"></span> label, I could write up book notes or even create a process doc for one of my creative projects with no pressure of growing it. I’ve already learned something with this: I recently wrote about <a class="internal-link" href="/taking-photos-pets">taking photos of pets</a> which made me realize that one of my unquestioned, go-to camera settings was objectively not a good choice for that context.</p>

<p>The last thing I like about Roots is that it keeps my processes transparent. Projects usually sit aesthetically in the vacuum of a well-designed site, but the role of the Roots is to hammer those projects with so much context that they’re no longer pretty. And in the world of Web 2.0, that’s kinda nice.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>I have a few more ideas for how I want my creative work to grow over time in this space, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve built enough infrastructure to start using it and assess it before I keep going with more. I planned this structure with the hope that I’ll get a good web of connections between most Plants and Roots, and I’m curious to see how much that will be true.</p>
