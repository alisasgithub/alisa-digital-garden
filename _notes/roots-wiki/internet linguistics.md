This book is alllll about internet linguistics. Internet linguistics are a new branch of linguistics that examines new language patterns that have emerged as a result of the internet. Gretchen McColluch points out that the internet is the first place where casual writing has entered the mainstream -- that is, people on the internet write more than they ever have in any other time in history.

McCulloch mentions **casings** (`lol` vs. `LOL`), and **keysmashing** (`agdj;kasgjk` vs. `~Iw=L2/Bl_W`) as examples of linguistic rules that arose from the internet. People will retype keysmashes to make it look right, and she points out how it's even distinguishable from cats walking across the keyboard (`tfgggggggggggggggggggsxdzzzzzzzz`). That is to say, these new linguistic rules have given us new ways of making meaning out of new strings of characters which would be completely unintelligible to anyone unfamiliar with internet culture.
